I have reworked it extensively, partly because I just like doing things like that. But the primary impetus for this rewrite is an attempt to get it working on Windows10 systems. While it worked fine, and continues to work fine, on my Windows7 system it has various problems on Windows10. The issues may or may not be with respect to how the user has his/her Windows10 system setup for TextToSpeech and SpeechRecognition.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) I do not have a Windows10 system, therefore identifying and fixing the issues, or just helping users set up their operating system to play friendly with this application is a beyond my capability.

Consider that a request for assistance from a Windows10 user who can debug and compile c#/.net on his or her own system. It would be nice to get this working because people still use it.

Beware that the problems could have something to do with Windows that have been set up with languages other than US English.
